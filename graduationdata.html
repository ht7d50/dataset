<h1> About graduation data </h1>
<p> The data used in this web app is from the CORGIS Dataset Project and can be found <a href="https://corgis-edu.github.io/corgis/json/graduates/">here.</a> 
The data contains information about college majors such as how much certain majors can make, the employment rate, and the number of degrees awarded to the people in the major during the listed year.
The data from this dataset comes from the National Survey of Recent College Graduates. Because a lot of majors were not available before 2010, their data has not been recorded.
One of the statistics recorded in this dataset was the mean salaries for the people who graduated with a certain degree. 
Another statistic that this data contains is the reason for why people aren't working, such as complications with family, no jobs being available, or because they are still a student and are busy with their education. </p>
